An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for software development. An IDE typically includes a source code editor, a compiler or interpreter, and a debugger, as well as other tools such as a version control system, project management tools, and more. IDEs are designed to make the software development process more efficient and streamlined by providing a single interface for managing all aspects of a project. They can be used for a wide variety of programming languages and frameworks, and are popular among developers working on both small and large projects.
